# Crowdfunding-ETL

For the ETL mini project, you will work with a partner to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After you transform the data, you'll create four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, youâ€™ll upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database.


The instructions for this mini project are divided into the following subsections:

1. Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames

2. Create the Campaign DataFrame

3. Create the Contacts DataFrame

4. Create the Crowdfunding Database
